As a dedicated senior at New York University, I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in both Mathematics and Web Programming and Applications. Currently, I'm enriching my academic journey through collaboration with [Professor Anurag Khandelwal](https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com) from Yale University, delving into the fascinating area of GPU memory disaggregation.

My research is anchored at the crossroads of systems, networking, and security, areas that allow me to continuously challenge and expand the boundaries of our current knowledge. I have also broadened my academic spectrum through past projects in Natural Language Processing and VR/AR Development.

Driven by an unwavering passion for my field, I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focusing on these disciplines. I am committed to deepening my understanding, making significant contributions to the tech field, and actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with others who share this commitment to advancing these essential tech domains.
