As a dedicated senior at New York University, I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in both Mathematics and Web Programming and Applications. I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Professor Joseph Bonneau](https://jbonneau.com/) and [Professor Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/) to explore the potential of applying zero-knowledge proofs to legacy crypto protocols. In parallel, I am extending the groundbreaking work I initiated during my internship, focusing on GPU memory disaggregation under the guidance of [Professor Anurag Khandelwal](https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com).

My research is anchored at the crossroads of systems, networking, and security, areas that allow me to continuously challenge and expand the boundaries of our current knowledge. I have also broadened my academic spectrum through past projects in Natural Language Processing and VR/AR Development.

Driven by an unwavering passion for my field, I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focusing on these disciplines. I am committed to deepening my understanding, making significant contributions to the tech field, and actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with others who share this commitment to advancing these essential tech domains.
