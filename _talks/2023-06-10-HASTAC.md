Partnering again with Dr. Rosanna Flouty and Prof. Craig Kapp, we dove deeper into the practical applications of our AR VLP Garden project, further illuminating the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) for fostering accessibility. We guided using specific tools like Adobe Aero, enabling participants to construct their AR prototypes. Participants were introduced to fundamental techniques such as world tracking and image tracking, fostering hands-on experience creating accessible, engaging AR environments.
