collection: publications
type: "Project"
advisor: "Prof. Craig Kapp & Prof. Rosanna Flouty"
permalink: /project/2022-12-ar
keyword: "Human Computer Interaction, Augmented Reality"
description: "We developed an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) platform, designed specifically for enhancing the visitor experience at the historic Villa La Pietra museum. With a particular focus on making cultural heritage accessible to individuals with disabilities, we tailored the platform to cater to those using wheelchairs and those with reduced vision or hearing. Our development process involved a thorough exploration of existing AR frameworks' accessibility features. Ultimately, we amalgamated the capabilities of 8th Wall and A-Frame, enriching our platform with detailed textual and auditory interactions. This resulted in an immersive AR experience that pushes the boundaries of inclusivity and accessibility."
