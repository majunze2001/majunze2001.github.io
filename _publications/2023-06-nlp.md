description: 'Our team engineered a system adept at differentiating between human and machine-generated text. We extracted five key statistical features from the text: average sentence length, ratio of repetitive words, entropy, punctuation frequency, and digit count. In addition, we also utilized Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features to enhance our analysis. To achieve optimal performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search and applied machine learning models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) for the classification of AI-generated excerpts.'
